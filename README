Make your models feel like they are in high school again.  This plugin retrieves
the most frequently occurring values for each column.  It adds methods of
the form most_popular_pluralized_column_name.  You can control how many results you get
with the :limit option.  The default limit is 5.

Usage

class Exercise < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_most_popular
end

class YourController < ActionController::Base
	def index
		@popular_exercises = Exercise.most_popular_names
	end
end

Notes

The most_popular_* methods take plural column names.

Testing
